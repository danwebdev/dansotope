dansotope
=========

dansotope will become a jquery plugin for layouting and rendering grid-layouts.
It will come especially handy for portfolio-type parts of websites.

Currently the grid only works with one-size grid items (all items share the same width). This will change in future.

There will be 2(3?) layout-mode available:

 * ### 'fixed-item-width'
 * ### 'fixed-gutter-width' (currently implemented)
