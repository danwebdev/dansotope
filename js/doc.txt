2 layout modes (both responsive):

-variable columns
	this is the default mode. 
	it is active as long as no columns array is supplied.


	the only required parameter here is "max-width".
	max-width is the maximum width an item should have.
	in this mode dansotope creates so many columns, that a maximum number of tile fit in a row.
	to avoid unwanted margins/gaps, tiles are scaled down a bit, but never scaled up.

-fixed columns
	this mode is activated by supplying a columns object to the opations.
	the columns object contains an array of objects with breakpoints and corersponing numbers of columns.
	for example:
	[
		{
			'value' : 1400,
			'columns' : 6
		},
		{
			'value' : 800,
			'columns' : 4
		},
		{
			'value' : 400,
			'columns' : 2
		},
	]

	This means: 
		as long as the container-width is below 400px use 2 columns and scale items (up or down) to fit.
		as long as the container-width is between 400px and 800px use 4 columns and scale items (up or down) to fit.
		as long as the container-width is below 400px use 2 columns and scale items (up or down) to fit.
